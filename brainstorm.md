adds a vertex in the middle of each edge, and moves it in our out

catmull rom subdivision

mirror right side to left

reflect all vertices about the origin

rotate

shear

divide

delete every other vertex

round corners

remix, swap quadrants with two others.

"make spiky", if a vertex angle is acute, it gets acuter.

cut a hole in the middle: copy each vertex and move it toward the center a bit, reverse direction.

split button, duplicates all vertices to the side, copies eyes, etc.

swap hole shape with outer boundary shape

add a single vertex

fractal operations:
adds a triangle on every edge.

add a copy of the shape at every vertex

swap edges and vertices

"3d effect"
